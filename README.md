Q/A using ChatGPT API Documentation
Introduction

The "Q/A using ChatGPT API" script is a Go (Golang) script that allows you to interact with the OpenAI ChatGPT API to ask questions and receive responses. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, usage, and how to replace the API key to use your own.
Getting Started

To use the "Q/A using ChatGPT API" script, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have Go (Golang) installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

    Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    Open the Go script (qa_using_chatgpt_api.go) in a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

    Replace the YOUR_API_KEY placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key.

    Execute the script using the following command:


    go run qa_using_chatgpt_api.go

    Follow the prompt to enter your question or query.

    The script will send your question to the OpenAI ChatGPT API, and the response will be displayed.

Code Structure

The "Q/A using ChatGPT API" script consists of the following components:
1. Constants


const (
	modelID = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
	apiKey  = "YOUR_API_KEY" // Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
)

In this section, you define constants for the ChatGPT model ID and your API key. Ensure that you replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your own OpenAI API key.
2. ChatMessage Struct



type ChatMessage struct {
	Role    string `json:"role"`
	Content string `json:"content"`
}

This struct defines the structure of a chat message, which includes a role ("user" or "assistant") and the content of the message.
3. callOpenAIChatAPI Function


func callOpenAIChatAPI(messages []ChatMessage) (string, error) {
	// ...
}

This function sends a list of chat messages to the OpenAI ChatGPT API and receives a response. It handles the HTTP request, authorization, and response parsing. If successful, it returns the AI's response.
4. main Function


func main() {
	// ...
}

The main function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to input a question, calls the callOpenAIChatAPI function to get a response, and then displays the response.
Usage

    Execute the script using the command go run qa_using_chatgpt_api.go.

    When prompted, enter your question or query.

    The script will send your question to the OpenAI ChatGPT API.

    The AI will generate a response to your question.

    The response will be displayed on the console.

Replacing the API Key

Ensure that you replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual OpenAI API key. You can obtain your API key by signing up for an OpenAI account and generating an API key from the OpenAI platform.
Conclusion

The "Q/A using ChatGPT API" script allows you to interact with the OpenAI ChatGPT API to ask questions and receive responses. By following the instructions in this documentation, you can set up the script, replace the API key, and start using it for various question-and-answer tasks. This tool can be useful for automating responses to common questions or conducting Q&A sessions with the ChatGPT model.
